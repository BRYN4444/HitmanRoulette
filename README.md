# ABOUT

Hitman Roulette is a tool that aims to give new ideas on how to complete missions in Hitman 2 (2018) by giving a set of random guidelines to follow when playing. Currently it randomizes things such as entry/exit point, kill method and worn disguise, as well as a set of extra variables, some of which are generic and some mission specific.

The [original tool](https://thekotti.github.io/about.html) (created by [TheKotti](https://twitter.com/TheKotti)) works with Hitman (2016), Hitman 2 (2018) and Hitman: Blood Money, along with having simpler controls, and less stuff to load.

## Compatibility

This was a project I worked on during my free time to brush up on my simple javascript, jQuery, and CSS knowledge. I've only tested this with Firefox & Chrome and I'm sure my additions to the existing code, as well as my own work, could use cleaning up here and there. If you find any issues, [let me know via GitHub](https://github.com/BRYN4444/HitmanRoulette/issues). - [BRYN](http://bryn.info/)

### To-Do List / Wishlist:
* Proper formatting on mobile devices; attempt at adaptive design.
* Copy the roulette as a text string to save locally. (I would love a way to seed this, but that's beyond my abilities)
* Replace image file format to webp to decrease filesize and get everything loading quicker.
* Proper images for Targets in Contracts Mode. None of these carry over from Hitman so they have to be retaken.
* Need Targets (and Intel) for Contracts Mode on the Hitman 2 maps. Also, since the Hitman 1 list was carried over, those will need to be double checked.
* More Extra Objectives for late-campaign Hitman 2.
