# ABOUT

Hitman Roulette is a tool that aims to give new ideas on how to complete missions in the latest Hitman trilogy of games by giving a set of random guidelines to follow when playing. It randomizes things such as mission entry and exit points, elimination method and worn disguise, generic and mission specific variables, and even targets for Contracts Mode.

[The original Hitman Roulette](https://thekotti.github.io/about.html) (created by [TheKotti](https://twitter.com/TheKotti)) is a more straight forward version that also works with Hitman: Blood Money.

## How To Use

All missions from the trilogy are pulled into the Roulette by default, so go to Select Missions above to untoggle any missions you're missing or just the ones you don't like.
After that, the options under Roulette Settings allow you to alter what the Roulette surfaces. You can get more than the regular targets (Mission Mode Roulette) by choosing Contract Mode Roulette. Dial in the difficulty by toggling Kill Requirements like disguises or weapons you'll need to wear or use, Extra Requirements like one more objective or sets of complications, and Gameplay Challenges that force you to change how you play.
To quickly return the Roulette Settings back to default, preform a hard refresh of the page.

## Compatibility & Issues

Currently, the Roulette works best with **Hitman 2 Gold Edition** and the **GOTY Legacy Pack**, though you can deselect any locations you do not own. However, you may have to ignore any conflicting gameplay traits, like difficuty, that changed between game releases.
This was a hobby project I started in 2016/17 and have worked on during my free time as a way to brush up on my simple javascript, jQuery, and CSS knowledge as well as giving me more reason to play these new Hitman games well after unlocking everything. As such, I've only tested this at about a 1080p resolution using the browsers I frequent: Firefox and Chrome. Also I'm sure my additions to the existing code, as well as my own work, could use cleaning up here and there. If you find any issues or glaring conflicts with roulette results, [let me know via GitHub](https://github.com/BRYN4444/HitmanRoulette/issues) and I'll try and address it when I get the chance. - [BRYN](http://bryn.info/)

### To-Do List / Wishlist:
* The Hitman 3 campaign (and additional mechanics) will be supported not too long after the game's release in 2021. With it will likely come a Hitman III style as the default appearance for the Roulette.
* More "Extra Objectives" for late-campaign Hitman 2.
* Allow Entrance Only and/or Exit Only roulette settings.
* This would take a complete overhaul, so it's probably out of MY league, but being able to link Roulettes to others would be cool. If you have knowledge on how to do this easily, leave me a message on [Github](https://github.com/BRYN4444/HitmanRoulette/issues).

### Latest Update (Oct. 1, 2020)
* **Mobile Friendly / Low Resolution Browsing.** After a few issues, you can now run the Roulette off your phone. While tabbing between sections isn't as smooth as desktop, and imagery will be squished for targets/objectives, I'm happy with this working at all! If your mobile browser is lacking functionality compared to the desktop version, please let me know, and I'll try and look into it.
* **Sarajevo Six Missions reimplememted.** I removed these when initially revamping the Roulette for Hitman 2 back in 2019. I re-added them, but they do not fall under the "All Locations" toggle, nor are they selected by default. They have to be manually chosen each time due to their platform and game exclusiveness.
* **Hitman 1 and Hitman GOTY styles added.** I always loved the menu colors from the launch of Hitman that were done away with for the Game of the Year update. I added both as optional themes that can be turned on in Roulette Settings.
* **Preperations underway for Hitman III additions.** Some visible buttons and backend code added as a sort of commitment from me that Hitman III stuff will be added AFTER I playthrough the game myself.
