# ABOUT

Hitman Roulette is a tool that aims to give new ideas on how to complete missions in Hitman 2 (2018) by giving a set of random guidelines to follow when playing. Currently it randomizes things such as entry/exit point, kill method and worn disguise, as well as a set of extra variables, some of which are generic and some mission specific.

[The original Hitman Roulette](https://thekotti.github.io/about.html) (created by [TheKotti](https://twitter.com/TheKotti)) also works with Hitman: Blood Money. It has simpler controls and way less imagery to load.

## How To Use

First, select the pool of missions the roulette will choose from. All missions are selected by default, so untoggle the missions you are missing. Or just untoggle the missions you don't like.  
The next choice should be the mode you'd like the roulette to be in, which will determine what targets you get. Just like within the game, you can get more than the regular targets (Mission Mode Roulette) by choosing Contract Mode Roulette.  
After that, your last set of picks will dial in the difficulty. Test and experiment to find the settings you like. Toggle: Kill Requirements like disguises or weapons you'll need to wear or use, Extra Requirements like one more objective or sets of complications, and Gameplay Challenges that force you to change how you play.

## Compatibility & Issues

This was a hobby project I started in 2016/17 and have worked on during my free time as a way to brush up on my simple javascript, jQuery, and CSS knowledge as well as giving me more reason to play these new Hitman games well after unlocking everything. As such, I've only tested this using Firefox and Chrome on a pretty old PC. I'm sure my additions to the existing code, as well as my own work, could use cleaning up here and there. If you find any issues or glaring conflicts with roulette results,  [let me know via GitHub](https://github.com/BRYN4444/HitmanRoulette/issues) and I'll try and address it when I get the chance. - [BRYN](http://bryn.info/)

### To-Do List / Wishlist:
* More "Extra Objectives" for late-campaign Hitman 2.
* Allow Entrance Only and/or Exit Only roulette settings.
* Proper formatting on mobile devices; attempt at adaptive design.
* Generate the roulette as text in a way it can be save locally.
* This would take a complete overhaul, but being able to link roulettes to others would be cool.
