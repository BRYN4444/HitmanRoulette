# ABOUT

Hitman Roulette is a tool that aims to give new ideas on how to complete missions in Hitman (2016) by giving a set of random guidelines to follow when playing. Currently it randomizes things such as entry/exit point, kill method and worn disguise, as well as a set of extra variables, some of which are generic and some mission specific.

The [original tool](https://thekotti.github.io/about.html) (created by [Kotti](https://twitter.com/TheKotti)) works with both Hitman (2016) and Hitman: Blood Money, along with having easier control, and less images and code to load.

### Differences offered here:
* Themed to look like the launch menus of Hitman (2016). Because the old menus looked better.
  * Uses images for each mission, location, target, objective, and complication. (In-game or hand-taken).
  * Click on a target or objective to mark it as eliminated or completed.
  * If an entry/exit point or person's name is too long, hover over it auto-scroll.
* Use `Shift+Click` or `Ctrl+Click` to select the pool of levels to pull from. "Random" is default.
  * Added "Freeform Training" and "The Final Test" even though they're not fully compatible.
  * Also added the PS4 exclusive targets "The Sarajevo Six" for variety and those that own them.
* When generating targets for "Contract Mode", intel is shown for their general location.
* Lowered the default complications randomized from 6 to 3, but allow the limit to be set back manually.
  * Reworded these complications to fit in game examples as well as add more.
* Added extra variable toggles for more granularity and challenge:
  * "Extra Objectives" adds a random mission specific task to complete.
  * "Restricted Mechanics" picks an in game option to disable. Usually HUD restricting.
  * "Challenge Run" picks a single or mix of Silent Assassin, Professional Difficulty, or a time limit.


## Compatibility

This was a project I worked on during my free time to brush up on my simple javascript, jQuery, and CSS knowledge. I've only tested this with Firefox and Chrome, and I'm sure my additions to the existing code, as well as my own work could use cleaning up here and there.


## Special Thanks
* Kotti, for his original Hitman Roulette that inspired this spin-off.
* Winterbird's [Hitman Interactive Maps](http://hitmanmaps.com/) for being a good tool. Update, please!
* [IO Interactive](https://www.ioi.dk/) for making a game I keep coming back to even though I've 100%'ed it. Congratulations for going independent and I'm looking forward to the sequel! (Psst: Please put a feature like this in the game, thanks.)
